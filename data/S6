CAIRO — Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi has revoked part of a controversial decree giving himself sweeping powers but he insists a referendum on a new constitution will go ahead as planned on December 15.  Opposition leaders call the move cosmetic and say they want the referendum postponed. 

Egyptian Air Force jets overflew the center of Cairo at low altitude Sunday as the political crisis continued.  Opposition leaders repeated calls for popular protests, despite a concession by President Mohamed Morsi.  He withdrew part of a constitutional decree putting his actions above judicial oversight.

The decision was announced late Saturday by Mohamed Salim al Awa, an Islamist member of a dialogue committee that met with the president.

He says the first clause of the constitutional declaration of November 21, which gave the president broad powers, has been annulled as of Saturday, but its consequences remain in effect.

The opposition National Salvation front met behind closed doors Sunday to discuss what new measures to take, including a possible general strike.  Mohamed ElBaradei, who heads the group, insisted the draft constitution “thwarts our rights and freedom,” and “will be toppled today, before tomorrow."
